The **Skyblock** server is a type of survival that requires you to survive on a floating island, starting with a small one and expand it as time goes on.

In this chapter, we will go through the game flow and guide you through your life on the floating island, helping you out to get everything on track

!!! **INFO**: This server is not our original work. Instead, it is migrated and based on the skyblock in HKMCIUS as it was closed down

## Introduction

**Skyblock** is a server created and mainly developed by ItzJacky, at the time when the server was still serving the HKMCIUS server. As skyblock is a popular game style, which features islands, Custom Enchants, Economy and much more, it serves as an entry-point to an alternative survival style. Before starting your own island, there are some basic requirements which you need to have...

## Requirements
* Basic Survival Skills (i.e. avoid creepers, punch tree, ~~fall off edges~~, kill monsters...etc. )
* Not afraid of height (more accurately, the void)
* A finger dedicated to the `Shift` key (Why? You will know that after your first death)
* Some freezing cold drink at your reach (Why? Again, you will know that after your first death)

So, look like we are all equipped and ready for the journey.... Let's get started with our very first island!
