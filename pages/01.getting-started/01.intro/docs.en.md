Welcome to the CoreCrafted Network, a place that is full of insanity and weird stuff.

In this handbook, we will talk through *(nearly)* everything you would have to know, and probably wanted to know, like rules, tips , server features, and even complete guide for a specific server.

The goal of this handbook is equip you with the ideas of different servers, and thus enhance the experience in game by avoiding misunderstandings and wrong perceptions.

## Who are we?

We are a combination of 2 distinct server, namely **REDCRAFT** and **i-survive Network**, owned by ThisTNTSquid and jasonc123456 respectively before merging. Both of us first started the cooperation in the manner of collaboration , and a few months later, due to an incident concerning both of our domain name, we merged and became the **CoreCrated Network** you know and love today.

In Late 2016, a random ItzJacky appeared! Coming From HKMCIUS(TWL later renamed), after the closing of TWL , he joined us as a Co-Owner.

So, back to the question, who exactly are we? We are nothing more than a group of poor people who have emptied their pouch to launch this server... just for bringing in something
that is "playable", and a community that worths staying with. That's it, we are not opening this server for the satisfying feeling of being the "Boss" or even the "King", we do
nearly everything ourselves and do give a good care of the server, ourselves.

## The Purpose

Our purpose of launching a server is pretty simple and straight-forward.
* Providing players with new ideas and special gameplay experience
* Share the pleasure of playing and staying with each other through Minecraft
* Freshen up the Hong Kong Minecraft server community, again :) *(You probably notices that there are more and more shitty servers coming out recently)*

## Our History

> It was quite a long story...... I afraid if I put it here, the page would be incredibly long and boring. If you are **REALLY** interested in the story of our server , please contact our mentally insane server owner ThisTNTSquid.
