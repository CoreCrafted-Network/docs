Welcome to the CoreCrafted Network, a place that is full of insanity and weird stuff.

In this handbook, we will talk through *(nearly)* everything you would have to know, and probably wanted to know, like rules, tips , server features, and even complete guide for a single server.

The goal of this handbook is equip you with the idea of different servers, and thus enhance the experience in game by avoiding misunderstandings and wrong perceptions.

## Who are we?

We are a combination of 2 distinct server, namely **REDCRAFT** and **i-survive Network**, owned by ThisTNTSquid and jasonc123456 respectively before the merge. Both of us first started cooperation in the manner of collaboration , and a few months later, due to an incident concerning both of our domain name, we merged and became the **CoreCrated Network** you knew and love today.
